# JavaScript-Challenge
In this assignment, I will write code that will create a dynamic table based upon a dataset provided, using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript and D3.js.

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
I will create a basic HTML web page, and using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. I will use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the datetime column to find rows that match user input.

## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
After completing all of Level 1 criteria, I will then use multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns and write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

-datetime
-city
-state
-country
-shape
